##Why you need to create tests
###Tests will save you time
- In a more sophisticated application, you might have dozens of complex interactions between components. A change in any of those components could have unexpected consequences on the application’s behavior
###Tests don’t just identify problems, they prevent them
- Without tests, the purpose or intended behavior of an application might be rather opaque. Even when it’s your own code, you will sometimes find yourself poking around in it trying to find out what exactly it’s doing. Tests change that; they light up your code from the inside, and when something goes wrong, they focus light on the part that has gone wrong - even if you hadn’t even realized it had gone wrong.
###Tests make your code more attractive
###Tests help teams work together
